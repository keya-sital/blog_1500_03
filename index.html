                Johnson & Johnson and SciBase are teaming up to use the Nevisense Go system to detect ezcema, a chronic skin disease.
                Nevisense Go uses AI to examine the child's skin for abnormalities in a non invasive way.
                In summary, this technology has made early detection easier on youth and has been approved in U.S., Europe and Australia.
